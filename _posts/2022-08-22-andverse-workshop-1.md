# Andverse workshop#1 is coming

***Rules:***  
Sign up for the online sessions during the event to explore the construction of the Metaverse with industry professionals you are interested in, and let professionals guide you into the world of Andverse. In response to social needs, the metaverse is developed to make our lives more fulfilling and beautiful, but the various problems that arise in the process cannot be solved in a short time, such as privacy issues and monopoly issues. We are committed to exploring a more decentralized, more secure, more flexible, and more interesting metaverse. This event invites all friends who are interested in the development of the Metaverse to join. Participants can become the first players to create "The Matrix" by themselves. Let's start your creative journey and make a money journey together. We will introduce you to this 3D world and take you to explore the Andverse.

***The details:***  
Andverse is a decentralized multigalactic world. The Andromeda metaverse, referred to as Andverse for short, will lead different players to open a new virtual experience in the world of blockchain. In this multiverse world‚ÄîAndverse, there are infinite possibilities waiting for players to discover and explore, and Planet [#3](https://github.com/newtonproject/community/issues/3), which has been discovered at this stage, will serve as the starting point for players. Starting from here, with our own land resources, let us build a world where consensus belongs. Realize your architectural, design and furnishing dreams. In this decentralized world, you can lease land, display digital collections that you own, or rent digital collections to other players for decoration. Here, you will be able to have your own store, build your own brand, and start playing to earning. Let's look forward to a decentralized personal ID in Andverse.¬†[https://www.andverse.org/](https://www.andverse.org/)
